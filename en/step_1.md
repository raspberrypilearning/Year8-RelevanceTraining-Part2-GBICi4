## Part 2: Year 8 'Relevance' training â€“ Getting started
You will be using App Lab to teach key programming concepts in the production of an app for a mobile device. Students do not need to be familiar with programming at the start of the trial. Teachers should be familiar with app design, idea development, and App Lab. 

Parts 2 and 3 of this course focus on building up your expertise in advance of the trial, as well as familiarising yourself with the teaching resources for the trial. Over the rest of this online course, you will have an opportunity to explore all the resources for yourself, try them out, and think about how to implement the sessions in your own classroom.

This part of the course, Part 2, begins to introduce you to the teaching resources. Through two tasks, you will focus on the development of your own app idea that addresses a real-world problem. You will complete two sessions that the students themselves will undertake as part of the trial. 

## Accessing the resources
First, you are going to access the session resources that you will need for the trial. 

--- task ---

Open the ['Relevance' resource portal](https://ncce.io/relevance){:target="_blank"}, where you can explore all the resources for Sessions 1 to 13. The webpage is the access portal for all the resources relating to the Relevance trial.

You can download the resources or access them each time you need them from the webpage. You may wish to bookmark the link to the resources in the browser toolbar of your tablet or computer for ease of reference in the classroom. 

You can also find links to all of the resources in your [project guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1by0Blwi9Iq2iXvPBdKwuz5ZYqmGdZdb-FR8y5bJGH64){:target="_blank"} or in the [Scheme of Work](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fxw-gP-9OHx1j4xNi8MoEPkOI6JsfudbR_LAWo8dOxY){:target="_blank"}, and you can also access them via [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tQZotIt90oK6WTsA_p1grJH4hGebG-Mm?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}.

The main resources folder consists of one subfolder entitled 'Sessions' (containing resources for the 13 sessions/one-hour lessons), as well as four further files: 
+ Scheme of Work (SoW) (text document)
+ App development student workbook (slides for use as worksheets)
+ Guide to setting up App Lab logins (text document)
+ Tea-break training on teamwork (slides)

Take some time now to gain a brief overview of the 'Scheme of Work (SoW)'. You will have the opportunity to understand the sessions in more detail in the next steps.
