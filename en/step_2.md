## The sessions
Session 1 introduces students to app development in general. In Sessions 2 to 4, students are introduced to the App Lab online environment and related blocks that can be used to construct a sample app. In Sessions 5 to 7, students are gradually introduced to the process of developing ideas for apps that can address a real-world problem. Over the course of Session 8 and the subsequent sessions, students explore the programming concepts of sequencing and selection to produce an app of their choice.

In the main 'Sessions' folder, you will find 13 numbered session subfolders.

Please note that Sessions 7 and 11 are optional sessions, and teachers delivering the Scheme of Work can decide whether to include them. 

In Session 7 â€“ Industry engagement, students pitch their ideas to an industry Expert online. If you would like your students to undertake Session 7, you need to make arrangements at least a week in advance of delivering the session. See the [Session 7 lesson primer](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LJ-cINBklLBknOfxHQq9WS0EAxRfOw6U_AqS0XC96Qo){:target="_blank"} for further details on this optional session.

Session 11 is a second app building session. If students undertake both Session 10 and 11, they will have two full sessions to build their app. In Session 12, students finish building their app.

Each session folder includes the following, where applicable:
+ Lesson primer
+ Lesson plan
+ Teacher slides
+ Student worksheet
+ Student checklist

The session folders may also include session-specific associated resources, such as related step-by-step guides.
