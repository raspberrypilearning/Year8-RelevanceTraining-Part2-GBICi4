## Task 1: App idea development

Watch this [video](https://youtu.be/e1St8LB4VJA){:target="_blank"} to hear why App Lab is great for teaching programming in the classroom.

In this task, you will explore apps, their design, and what apps that address real-world problems are currently in the marketplace.

Read the two sets of teacher slides from [Session 1](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/144Uc-9llYy4LVkKkD0AYTn5ZLM_vWLcPhGiIbuctNXs){:target="_blank"} and [Session 5](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1aca6FNN8WHA136iyUT-TI8LxI0CkND28hiXcQH6na0U){:target="_blank"}. These slides give you a clear understanding of the idea development process during the introductory session and the subsequent idea development sessions, and include links to a number videos that are very informative.

Now work through [Session 6](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MDhtKM8quM0U11biljR4F_LdRfMO-chk?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}, which will help to build on your existing knowledge of app design and idea development. Exploring the resources in detail will improve your understanding of how the different files work together in the session. It will also allow you to experience the session from a student's perspective.

Keep a record of your ideas developed during Part 2 of this course using the student worksheets (or student workbook) provided. In Part 3 of this course, you will use the ideas that you have developed towards a working app.
